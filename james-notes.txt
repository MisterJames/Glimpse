GlimpseConfiguration.cs - hashing for client scripts

Handler pipeline - this is where the client scripts will be output, merged on secondary/tertiary requests

IStaticClientScript - currently used to register a client script, but doesn't affect bundle rendering

ClientScript - In enum this refers to the main Glimpse payload

IResource - use this to payload the bundled JS

IDynamicClientScript - used to embed core scripts in the page

GlimpseConfiguration - access the client scripts

Create:
  ClientScriptResource
  StringResourceResult (take a param for content encoding type)
  
RequestResponseAdapterDecorator(IRequestResponseAdapter ) : IRequestResponseAdapter
 - WriteHttpResponse writes to internal bufferish thing
